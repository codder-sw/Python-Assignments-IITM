Implement the following functions:

find_min: Find the minimum value in a list of integers.
Input: A list of integers.
Output: An integer, the minimum value in the list.
odd_increment_even_decrement_no_modify: Increment all the odd numbers in a list by 1 and decrement all the even numbers by 1, without modifying the original list.
Input: A list of integers.
Output: A new list of integers with the modified values.
odd_square_even_double_modify: Square all the odd numbers and double all the even numbers in a list, modifying the list in place.
Input: A list of integers.
Output: None (the input list is modified in place).
more_than_two_unique_vowels: Given a string of comma-separated words, return a set containing words that have more than two unique vowels.
Input: A string of comma-separated words.
Output: A set of words with more than two unique vowels.
sum_of_list_of_lists: Given a list of lists of integers, find the sum of all the integers in all the lists.
Input: A list of lists of integers.
Output: An integer, the sum of all the integers in the nested lists.
flatten: Flatten a list of lists into a single list.
Input: A list of lists.
Output: A single flattened list.
all_common: Find the common characters that are present in all strings in a list of strings and return them as a string in ascending order.
Input: A list of strings.
Output: A string containing common characters in ascending order.
vocabulary: Given a list of sentences (with only alphabets and spaces), find the vocabulary (list of unique words) and return it as a set. Convert all words to lowercase before adding to the vocabulary.
Input: A list of sentences.
Output: A set of unique words in lowercase.

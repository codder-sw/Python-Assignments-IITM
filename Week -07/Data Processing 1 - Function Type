Find the index of the row with maximum number of zeros in a matrix
Given a m x n matrix, find the index of the row with the maximum number of zeros. Assume there will be only one row with the maximum number of zeros.

Example

[
    [1,0,1,4,1],
    [1,5,1,1,2],
    [2,0,2,0,3],
    [3,0,0,0,4],
]
The 4th row(index 3) has the maximum number of zeros, so the answer is 3.

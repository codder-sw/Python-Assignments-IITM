filename is a text file that contains a collection of words in lower case, one word on each line. Write a function named get_freq that accepts filename as argument. It should return a dictionary where the keys are distinct words in the file, the values are the frequencies of these words in the file.

For example, given the following file:

good
great
good
work
work
The dictionary returned should be:

{'good': 2, 'great': 1, 'work': 2}
The order in which the words are added to the dictionary doesn't matter.

(1) filename is a string variable that holds the name of the file. For example, in the first test case, it is filename = 'public_1.txt'.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the console or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.

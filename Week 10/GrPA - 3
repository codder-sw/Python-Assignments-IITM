A class named Shape is given to you as a part of the prefix code. Write a class named Square that is derived from Shape with the following specification:

Attributes

Only those attributes that are specific to the derived class are mentioned below. The rest have to be inherited from the base class.

side: int, side of the square

Methods

Only those methods that are specific to the derived class are mentioned below. The rest have to be inherited from the base class.

(1) __init__: accept side as an argument:
(2) Call the constructor of the base class and set the name attribute to "Square" using it.
(3) Assign side to the corresponding attribute of this class.
(4) Call the methods compute_area and compute_perimeter within the constructor.
(5) compute_area: compute the area of the square and assign it to the attribute area.
(6) compute_perimeter: compute the perimeter of the square and assign it to the attribute perimeter.

(1) Each test case corresponds to one or more method calls. We will use S to denote the name of the object.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to define the class based on the specifications given in the question.

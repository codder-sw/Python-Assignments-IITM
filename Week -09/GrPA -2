Write a recursive function named linear that accepts the following arguments:

P: a non-empty list of positive integers
Q: a non-empty list of positive integers
k: a positive integer
It should return True only if both the conditions given below are satisfied:

P
P and 
Q
Q are of same length.
P
[
i
]
=
k
⋅
Q
[
i
]
P[i]=k⋅Q[i], for every integer 
i
i in the range 
[
0
,
len

[0,len(P)−1], endpoints inclusive.
You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.

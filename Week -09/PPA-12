A polynomial is a mathematical function of the following form:

f
(

)
=

The

 s are called the coefficients of the polynomial and uniquely determine it. This polynomial can be represented in Python using a list of its coefficients:

L = [a_0, a_1, a_2, . . ., a_n]

Note that L[i] corresponds to the coefficient

Write a recursive function named poly that accepts the list of coefficients L and a real number x_0 as arguments. It should return the polynomial evaluated at the value x_0. For example poly([1, 2, 3], 5) should return the value

You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.

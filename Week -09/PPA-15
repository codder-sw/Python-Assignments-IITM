You have a locker that has a finite number of coins in it. Each coin has some positive integer that is engraved on it. This denotes how valuable the coin is. You wish to draw a subset of coins from the locker whose total worth is 
s
s. Your task is to determine if this can be done with the coins available in your locker.

Write a recursive function named subset_sum that accepts a list of positive integers L and a positive integer s as arguments. The list L represents the coins in your locker. The integer s represents the total value of the coins that you need to withdraw. Return True if you can withdraw some subset of coins whose combined worth is 
s
s, return False otherwise.

(2) You do not have to accept input from the user or print the output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.
